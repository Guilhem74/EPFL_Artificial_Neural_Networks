[EPFL] Artificial Neural Networks

Two projects done for the lecture CS-456 at EPFL

http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/artificial-neural-networks-CS-456

The first miniproject is mostly about using keras/tensorflow and discover neural networks

Second project (called MiniProject3) is about reinforcement learning and developping an agent which learn how to play at a gym game.
The game used in that project is the Lunar Lander Game. 
The agent must be able to land a rocket on a lander in a 2D Space.
